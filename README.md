Integration Project

In order to launch the game it is important to first have pygame installed using pip.
To install pygame https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted has a good guide.

The path py -m pip install -U pygame --user
can also be entered into the windows command line to download pygame.

To start the game up, the file graphics.py must be launched. Of course everything else must be downloaded first.
The game is still in it's early stages.
Eventually we hope to have a guide within the game for the player.
